**Diligent Windows** is a collection of prototypes of various concept features of Windows 10 & Windows 10 Mobile. These concepts aim to enhance the user experience of existing Windows features. 

DiligentWindows uses the **Win2D** and **WPFSpark.UWP** libraries to create these concepts.

**Note:** *Though this is a Universal Windows Application, these concepts are best viewed on a desktop/tablet.*

This is a work in progress project, so you can expect additional concepts to be added in the near future. Any comments or suggestions are always welcome!
